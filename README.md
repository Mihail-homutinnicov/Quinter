## Contributing.

We ask that pull requests are submitted always, in order to avoid merge conflicts. In addition, if you have a big feature request/idea, it would be better if an issue is opened first, so we can discuss implementation, details, documentation, etc.

## Todo

* Add a timeline-specific find feature.
* Add bookmarks.
* Add shortcut keys for jumping to timelines
* Relative times
	* This won't be possible with our current listview, but maybe in invisible?
* Export buffers feature
* View blocked and muted users.
* add command line arguments for external player
